Lexia--Your-Ai-Your-Voice
Lexia is an intelligent voice-activated assistant built in Python that makes everyday tasks easier with natural voice commands.From opening websites to fetching weather updates, Lexia listens, understands, and acts—hands-free.It also comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users who prefer a visual experience.

Key Features
1. Voice Activation: Give commands like “Open Google” or “What’s the time?” and Lexia responds instantly.
2. Web Control: Launch websites (Google, YouTube, etc.) directly through speech.
3. Utility Commands: Get the current time, date, or weather updates on demand.
4.GUI Support: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter for smooth desktop interaction.
5. Speech Recognition & TTS: Powered by Python libraries for accurate speech-to-text and natural text-to-speech responses.

Tech Stack – Key Point
•	Python 3.x – Core programming language used for building the entire assistant due to its simplicity and extensive library support.
•	SpeechRecognition – Handles voice input and converts spoken commands into text
•	pyttsx3 – Provides text-to-speech functionality, enabling Lexia to give spoken responses.
•	Tkinter – Used for creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visual interaction.
•	Requests – Facilitates API integration to fetch real-time data like weather updates.
•	Operating Environment – Runs on Windows/Linux with standard Python dependencies.

 How Lexia Works
•	Listen: Listens continuously for user commands.
•	Recognize: Uses speech recognition to convert spoken words into text.
•	Process: Matches the text to predefined actions or functions.
•	Execute & Respond: Carries out the task and speaks back the result.
